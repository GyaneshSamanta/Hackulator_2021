## Problem Statement üöß

### Raising the bar for healthcare facilities

## Background üìñ



There‚Äôs a need to make people and processes in the healthcare sector made more accountable; for that greater operational transparency needs to be brought in urgently.

India‚Äôs healthcare system has been battling various issues, including the low number of institutions and less-than-adequate human resources for quite a while now.

Here's an incident that compelled us to come up with *healthcare2.0*;

A prominent city in India, 'Bengaluru' recently reported the lacking secondary healthcenters have been choking the entire medical sector for Bengaluru. It is important to note that Bengaluru is one of the most highly developed cities in India, comprising of multiple Information Technology hubs and a majority population in the age group of 25-40. 

The fact that one of the leading cities in India is facing a deprivity in health facilities says something about the other cities or worse rural towns. 

**HealthCare2.0 aims at uniting patients and doctors by assisting in getting healthcare to your fingertips**

## About Healthcare2.0 üîß
### What
**HealthCare2.0** is a Mobile and Web Application that enables it's user to book appointments with Doctors. The User, can sign up as a patient and can view his preious reports and appointments with the doctors. The doctors can sign up on the other end as doctors and accept or modify appointments.

### Why
We do not really have unified platforms which allow people to connect to doctors in a suitable way and only add on to the distress that family members face. With our platform **Healthcare2.0**, we promise the users to offer better accessibilty, add language support for different regions and help them find their doctors, as soon as possible.

### How
With a super simple User Interface and support for different languages, we make Booking appointments and accessing healthcare easy. Under the hood, we have a really elastically scalable system, deployed over to handle traffic. We are using Firebase to store and export data and we have tried our level best to offer people the smoothest experience. Currently, we are only offering support in our target country but in our future iterations we plan on expanding our services to different regions and take this idea forward, to help people find their doctors as effortlessly as possible.
